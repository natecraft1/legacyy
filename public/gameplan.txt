Problem to be solved:

no meaningful way to remember and display content about your life. this product will be different from 
existing websites in that...

MVP:

- users can create an account and login
- users can make single page posts about many specific years of their life with 1 picture, one text box for content and one post about what they learned or a specific memory
- users can view their "life timeline"

Milestones:
- home page with a link to sign up, sign in
- sign up page that stores new user in db
- user sessions on login
- be able to store posts for specific users and specific years to db
- display those posts
- potentially on the homepage as well 

Future plans:
- users can add monthly posts
